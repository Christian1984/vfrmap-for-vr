For v1.xx.y of FSKneeboard, I want to implement the following changes:

1. TODO

  - DETAIL

For all of the above, do not start implementation right away. Start by creating an implementation plan in `artifacts/v1-xx-y/implementation-plan.md` and create actionable TODOs in `artifacts/v1-xx-y/todo.md`. Organize the task list by features, and add task numbers to the items in the TODO list so that I can point the implementation agent to each task (e.g. "Implement Task 11"). Use `[ ]` for each task the agent can then check.

When doing your research, create an outline of your results in `artifacts/v1-xx-y/research/[task-id].md`.
